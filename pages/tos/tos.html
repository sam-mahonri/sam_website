                <li>Nature of the work</li>
                <ol class="sec_2">
                    <li>This excerpt from the article concerns prohibitions of what will never be done, the types of requests that will be refused immediately, even before partial negotiation.</li>

                    <li>The following are the factors that will result in an immediate interruption of the service:</li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Requests for the production of explicit and inappropriate content for minors under 18 or criminal, such as:
                            Arts NSFW¹/NSFL² — ¹Not Safe for work (Focus on explicit sexual activities), and, ²Not Safe for Life (Focus on graphic and visceral content, explicit gore), respectively — Do not insist, even offering higher prices the request will be refused. </li>
                        <li>Arts that portray criminal contexts or allusion to them — P*dofilia, Z*ofilia and E*tupro — Do not insist, even offering higher values the request will be refused.</li>
                        <li>Any content that makes me uncomfortable</li>
                        <li>The non-guarantee of payment on time, declaring that you are going to buy “on credit” is not allowed.</li>
                        <li>Declare that you want to "hurry the artist", if it is visible that during the process this occurs, the order will be canceled.</li>
                        <li>Order, without making payment, the semi-finished or finished content without the full watermarks (marks that cover the entire work to protect it) from the artist.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <li>The following are the requests that can be made in case of a significant increase in the value, defined by the artist himself:</li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Arts that may contain sexual content that are not explicit, just suggestive, for example, volume or subtle highlight in the genital region and suggestive poses where the characters are adults — The final value increase can vary from 50% to 80% of the partial value.</li>
                        <li>Art that contains low-impact graphic content, such as blood and minor injuries — The final value increase can range from 10% to 30% of the partial value</li>
                    </ol>
                </ol>
                <li>Budget and deadlines</li>

                 <ol class="sec_2">
                     <li>This section concerns the budget and deadlines for the service provided, this includes the details of the client's request and the estimated deadlines for each stage of the process, there may be advances or delays with prior notice to the client, in addition to the estimated value within of the templates applied based on the calculator *Estimate of the service*, it is advisable that the customer make the preliminary budget in this calculator and send the code generated by it to the service provider's Twitter DM at @SamMahonri, your message request will be accepted within 48 hours, before contacting me, check if I am available for these types of services.
                     </li>
                     <li>The next paragraph requires your use of the "Service Estimate" (Unavailable) calculator</li>


                     <li>Deadlines apply to all modalities (Arts, Designs and Music), and can be made more flexible by the service provider with prior notice, these terms and payment amounts are based on the following factors</li>
                     <ol>
                         <li>Initial fixed value depending on the size of the work (value provided by the calculator) — This symbolic value (R$ 5 ~ R$ 15) must be paid for the first draft of the work to be made and forwarded for the client's approval .</li>
                         <li>You will receive the first sketch within 5 business days of paying the fixed amount, this deadline depends on the size of the work. If you exceed this deadline, you will be refunded BRL 5 of the fixed amount paid every 5 days of delay.</li>
                         <li>After delivery of the first draft and approval by the client, 50% of the total amount must be paid for continuity. When any changes are made during the process, the customer will be constantly contacted to make improvements to the work, the objective is to leave the final work as close as possible to the customer's desire. — This process of developing the work and constant contact with the client can last from 2 days to 3 weeks, until the work is finalized and delivered.</li>
                         <li>During these small deliveries, the work will be presented with very apparent watermarks, the final result will be delivered with these watermarks and will only be removed when the other half of the total amount is paid. Note: If the work is musical, some distortions will be made in parts of the music until the amount is paid in full.</li>
                     </ol>
                     <li>Remembering that these deadlines, values and conditions can be changed according to more specific situations, either by the client or by the artist.
